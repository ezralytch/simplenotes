# SimpleNotes - Pro Tips & Best Practices

## For Optimizing Your Note-Taking Experience

### üöÄ Getting the Best AI-Generated Notes

1. **Be Specific in Your Session Notes**
   - Include concrete observations about client presentation (e.g., "Client appeared anxious, wringing hands, avoiding eye contact")
   - Note direct quotes from the client when relevant to treatment
   - Specify any assessments used or scoring changes
   - Clearly indicate interventions implemented during the session

2. **Structure Your Shorthand Input**
   - Even when using your own shorthand, try to loosely organize information into Data, Assessment, and Plan sections
   - Start statements about observations with "Client" to help the AI distinguish between your observations and client statements
   - Use bullet points or line breaks to separate distinct thoughts

3. **Optimal Template Usage**
   - Initial Assessment: Best for first-time clients, establishing baseline and treatment goals
   - Follow-Up Session: Ideal for regular weekly/monthly sessions, tracking progress against goals
   - Crisis Intervention: Use for unscheduled or emergency sessions, focused on immediate safety
   - Discharge Summary: Use when concluding treatment, summarizing progress and outcomes

4. **Quick Regeneration**
   - If the AI-generated note isn't quite right, it's often faster to regenerate than to make extensive edits
   - If regenerating, try adding more details to your input notes for better results

### üíª Technical Tips

1. **Keyboard Shortcuts**
   - Tab between fields for faster form completion
   - Use Ctrl+Enter (Cmd+Enter on Mac) in the session notes textarea to submit the form

2. **PDF Optimization**
   - For best PDF quality, ensure your browser zoom is set to 100%
   - Chrome typically produces the most consistent PDF results
   - Wait until the "Generating PDF..." message disappears before navigating away

3. **Signature Tips**
   - For touchscreen devices, use a stylus for more precise signatures
   - On desktop, using a mouse generally produces better results than a trackpad
   - Keep your signature within the boundaries of the signature box for best results

4. **Saving Time with Clinician Info**
   - Most browsers will offer to save your clinician information for future use
   - Accept this to speed up the signature process on subsequent notes

### üìù Documentation Best Practices

1. **Medical Billing Codes**
   - Keep a reference list of commonly used billing codes for faster entry
   - For mental health services, common codes include:
     - 90791: Psychiatric diagnostic evaluation
     - 90834: Psychotherapy, 45 minutes
     - 90837: Psychotherapy, 60 minutes
     - 90847: Family/couples therapy

2. **DAP Format Refinement**
   - **Data**: Focus on observable behaviors and direct statements, avoid interpretation
   - **Assessment**: This is where clinical judgment and interpretation belongs
   - **Plan**: Be specific about frequency, duration, and measurable goals

3. **Risk Documentation**
   - Always document risk assessments for suicidal/homicidal ideation
   - Note any safety plans created or referrals made
   - Document follow-up actions for identified risks

4. **Professional Language**
   - The AI will generate clinical language, but review to ensure:
     - Absence of stigmatizing language
     - Objective rather than judgmental descriptions
     - Person-first language when appropriate
     - Correct clinical terminology for your discipline

### üîí Privacy Enhancement

1. **Client Identifiers**
   - Consider using client initials or ID numbers instead of full names for added privacy
   - If your organization requires full names, you can add these just before downloading the PDF

2. **Secure Storage**
   - Immediately move downloaded PDFs to your secure EHR or encrypted storage
   - Don't leave PDFs in your downloads folder
   - Consider setting up automatic deletion of downloads folder contents

3. **Browser Privacy**
   - Use private/incognito browsing for an added layer of privacy
   - Clear browser cache after sessions
   - Avoid using shared or public computers

### üß† Optimizing for Different Treatment Approaches

1. **CBT-Focused Sessions**
   - Note specific cognitive distortions identified
   - Document thought records or cognitive restructuring exercises
   - Include homework assignments related to thought challenging

2. **Trauma-Informed Care**
   - Document grounding techniques used
   - Note specific trauma triggers identified (with client's permission)
   - Include observations about window of tolerance

3. **Solution-Focused Brief Therapy**
   - Document exceptions to the problem
   - Include scaling questions and responses
   - Note miracle question responses and goals

4. **Group Therapy**
   - Document group dynamics and individual participation
   - Note specific interventions used for the group as a whole
   - Include individual client responses to group processes
